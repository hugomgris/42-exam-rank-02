Exercise list taken from pasqualerossi's repo: https://github.com/pasqualerossi/42-School-Exam-Rank-02/tree/main

Code is my own.

Some of the exercise not be 100% right because I'm only a human after all. While I was preparing the exam I used at least half of this code with the grademe and they where all graded a success, but the one's that I never got while training are only tested by me. If you find any error, please tell me so I can fix it <3
